Hey! I'm Disguised and the owner of Asra as well as the Asra Paradise community server.

### How it all started

I launched [Asra Paradise](https://discord.gg/EbYwxMVfUA) to the public on the *18th January 2021* after making the decision to launch my own server using my experience gained from moderating and co-owning many other servers.
My mission was to make an amazing community server and provide the perfect place for everyone to make friends and meet new people.

I later decided I wanted to make my own bot for the server, [Asra](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=751171098971865119&permissions=1499983113431&scope=applications.commands%20bot), with the hope that one day it would be able to replace every single other bot in the server. I coded it using discord.js and added it to the server on the *27th March 2021* with only a couple commands. 
I've worked on it ever since, gradually adding more commands and more features until it became what it is today.

### Making the decision to go public

I recieved many requests from server members or friends asking if they could have the bot in their server but I initially declined all of these requests as I had intended for the bot to just be a custom-built bot to serve the Asra Paradise server and had hard-coded it to do so. 
Over time, I started to change my mind and in *December 2021*, I made the decision to open it to the public and let other people enjoy the benefits of Asra. I immediately began work on rewriting the bot and making it dynamic and as customisable as possible allowing users to specify roles, channels and more, toggling as many of the features as possible to suit their needs.

Fast forward 2 months to *February 2022* where the bot has been approved by a few advertising sites and is starting to appear gradually in a few more servers. I've teamed up with Mexi who will be creating a brand-new website for us and will also be helping upgrade the bot significantly to make it even better and more reliable! This will be a great partnership and will allow us to make more progress with the bot through shared knowledge. This also means we have merged support servers and websites, and he will be working on migrating features from his bot such as music commands into Asra!
