## How to set up Reaction Roles with Asra

_________________

View what reaction roles have been set up in your server using `/reactionrole list`.

To setup a new reaction role, use the command `/reactionrole add [channel] [messageid] [emoji] [role]`.

> üí° **Tip:** To get a message ID, right click the message on Discord, then click Copy ID. If you don‚Äôt see the copy ID option, make sure you have developer mode on. You can find it in your User Settings -> Advanced.


## Editing/Deleting a Reaction Role

_________________

To edit a reaction role, re-run the `/reactionrole add [channel] [messageid] [emoji] [role]` command and it will overwrite any changes made.

<br>
To delete a reaction role, use the command `/reactionrole remove [channel] [messageid] [emoji]`.

Note: Asra will not delete the message or remove the reactions from the reaction role message when deleted.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Manually deleting the reaction role message will not remove it from the reaction role list, make sure to delete it using the remove command for it to truly be deleted.
