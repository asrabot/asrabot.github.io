## How to set up Tickets with Asra

_________________

To setup a ticket panel in your server, use the command `/settings ticket [channel] [title] [supportrole] (logchannel) (embedcolour)`.

> #### Extra Info
>
> - Embedcolour should be a hex colour code in the format `#FFA500`
> - Log channels are optional and transcripts will be sent there if enabled when a ticket is deleted.
> - Transcripts will always be sent to the users dm (if their dms are enabled) regardless of whether a log channel has been specified.
