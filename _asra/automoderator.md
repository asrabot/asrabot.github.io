The Auto-Moderator will automatically moderate the text channels in Asra Paradise. It includes a number of different modules including a word blacklist, mention spam and links/server invite detector.

> **Be Aware:** Automod needs setting up in a server before it will work! Use the command `/settings setupautomod (channel)`. The channel is optional and is where automod actions will be logged.
