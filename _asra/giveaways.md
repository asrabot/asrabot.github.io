The Giveaways Module provides a range of commands to hold giveaways in your Discord server quickly and easily!

> **Be Aware:** Giveaways need setting up in a server before they can be used! Use the command `/settings setupgiveaways [channel] [role]`. The role defines who can create and manage giveaways.
