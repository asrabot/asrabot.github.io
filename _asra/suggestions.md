The Suggestion Module houses commands to suggest features for the server the bot is in or for features for the Asra bot.

> **Be Aware:** Suggestions need setting up in a server before they can be used! Use the command `/settings setupsuggestions [channel] [role]`. The role defines who can approve/reject suggestions once they are made.
