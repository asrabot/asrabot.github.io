description: A rewrite of the bot, going public and an inventory system - What more could you want from your favourite bot Asra?
---
### Slash command support
Asra has recently migrated to slash commands and with it has brought a whole host of new commands and features as well as better uptime. Find all new commands using `/help`

### Economy System
- Brand new Inventory system
- Sell items or gift items to other users
- Weekly command for Premium Users
- Economy commands no longer auto sell items collected but instead store them in your inventory where they can be sold or traded later.
Lots of items are planned to be added but suggestions are welcome.

### Vote Rewards
Each time you vote, you will now recieve 10,000 asra coins.

### Christmas 2021 Exclusive Item
For a LIMITED TIME ONLY, using ANY slash commands has a 1 in 200 chance of giving you a Christmas Present. This is an exclusive item for Christmas 2021 which can't be bought or sold (Only traded). This will be a very valuable item due to its rarity.

### Becoming a Public Bot
I've made the decision recently to open up the Asra bot to the public so everyone can now enjoy all the features it brings to the Asra Paradise community server themselves.<br/>
Asra is a fully customizable, multipurpose discord bot with a global economy system, custom welcome messages, giveaways, moderation, anti-spam, auto roles, tickets, and much more!<br/>
Please support us and try the bot out in your server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=751171098971865119&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands%20bot) to invite the bot!

### Premium
I've made the decision to introduce Asra Premium which is the paid version of Asra.<br/>
Whilst Asra is primarily a free bot, we have some premium only features to help support development and hopefully enable us to pay for hosting and improve the power and speed of the bot.<br/>
To learn more about how to redeem premium, visit our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/asraparadise).

### Suggestions for Features
Any suggestions for features or commands for the bot are welcome and can be submitted using `/botsuggest` or in the [Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/qwCzwBvRn9).


**Thank you for your support and for choosing to have Asra in your server.**
